                    Hello, Iâ€™m **Ramdan Suwandi**, a dedicated and passionate Informatics Engineering student at **Krisnadwipayana University**. With a strong academic background in IT since vocational high school and continuous learning in my university studies, I have developed a solid foundation in technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in the tech world began at a vocational high school, where I majored in Computer and Network Engineering. This provided me with a hands-on understanding of various technical skills, from network troubleshooting and hardware maintenance to software installation. A key experience during this time was a three-month internship as an IT Support and Assistant Lecturer at what is now Jakarta Global University (JGU), which sharpened my problem-solving abilities and communication skills in an academic setting. I also hold a competency certificate, which validates my technical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion for technology has evolved and deepened over the years. I am particularly enthusiastic about Front-end Development, UI/UX Design, and the groundbreaking world of Web3 and blockchain. My professional experience, including a role as a Bulky Operator at Shopee Express Indonesia for more than one year, has further equipped me with valuable skills. In this role, I was responsible for data input and operational management, utilizing a laptop to handle data accurately via Excel and other software. This experience has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, adaptability, and the ability to manage high-volume tasks in a fast-paced and challenging environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an active learner and am always seeking new challenges. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals to create impactful projects. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see a collection of my projects and accomplishments. I look forward to connecting and potentially collaborating on future endeavors in the dynamic world of technology.
